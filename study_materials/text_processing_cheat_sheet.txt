# ðŸ“‹ Text Processing - Cheat Sheet

Here is the condensed cheat sheet:

## KEY TERMS (most important definitions)

* **Information Retrieval (IR)**: Searching for relevant information from a large database or corpus
* **Text Classification**: Automatically assigning categories or labels to text data based on its content
* **Bag of Words**: Representing text data as a vector of word frequencies
* **Naive Bayes (NB)**: Supervised learning algorithm for classification tasks, assuming independence between features
* **k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)**: Supervised learning algorithm for classification tasks, classifying based on majority vote of nearest neighbors

## ALGORITHMS

* **Naive Bayes (NB)**: Classification task where features are independent
* **k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)**: Classification task where data is high-dimensional or has complex relationships
* **Rocchio**: Classification task where data is high-dimensional and has complex relationships, forms a centroid (prototype) for each class

## FORMULAS

* Bayes' Theorem:
P(C|D) = P(D|C) \* P(C) / P(D)

## MUST-KNOW FACTS

* 10,000 - 1,000,000 unique words in a typical text collection
* kNN can be more accurate than NB or Rocchio for high-dimensional data
* Naive Bayes is widely used in spam filtering due to its simplicity and effectiveness

## QUICK REFERENCE

* **Text Classification**: Use NB, kNN, or Rocchio algorithms
* **Bag of Words**: Represent text data as a vector of word frequencies
* **High-Dimensional Space**: A space with many dimensions, such as bag-of-words representation of text data
* **Google Alerts**: Service that sends email updates when new content matches search query

This cheat sheet should provide a quick review of the key terms, algorithms, and must-know facts for an exam.
