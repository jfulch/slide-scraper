# üÉè Deduplication - Flashcards

Here are 20 flashcard pairs based on the lecture content:

**Q1: What is de-duplication?**
A: The process of identifying and avoiding essentially identical web pages.

**Q2: Why is de-duplication used in web crawling?**
A: To index only a single version of identical or nearly identical web pages to return as search results.

**Q3: What are some examples of the same page being referenced by different URLs?**
A: Different host names (e.g., http://espn.go.com vs. http://www.espn.com), protocols (e.g., http vs. https), and paths/page names.

**Q4: What is Structural Classification of Proteins (SCOP)?**
A: A database that classifies proteins based on their structural similarity.

**Q5: How many PDB entries are in the 1.75 release of SCOP?**
A: 38,221

**Q6: What does SCOP stand for?**
A: Structural Classification of Proteins

**Q7: Who are some of the authors of the SCOP database?**
A: Alexey G. Murzin, John-Marc Chandonia, Antonina Andreeva, Dave Howorth, Loredana Lo Conte, Bartlett G. Ailey, Steven E. Brenner, Tim J.P. Hubbard, and Cyrus Chothia.

**Q8: What is the purpose of de-duplication in /ocker storage?**
A: To store only a single copy of a file and manage multiple links to it.

**Q9: Is de-duplication effective in saving space?**
A: Not clear and needs analysis for each particular application.

**Q10: What is the difference between identical and nearly identical web pages?**
A: Identical pages are exactly the same, while nearly identical pages have minor differences.

**Q11: How does SCOP classify proteins?**
A: Based on their structural similarity, including folds, superfamilies, and families.

**Q12: What is the reference for the 1.75 release of SCOP?**
A: Murzin A.G., Brenner S.E., Hubbard T.J.P., Chothia C. (1995).

**Q13: Who are some of the authors of the recent changes to SCOP?**
A: Lo Conte L., Brenner S.E., Hubbard T.J.P., Chothia C., Murzin A.

**Q14: What is the purpose of de-duplication in web crawling?**
A: To reduce storage space and improve search results by indexing only a single version of identical or nearly identical web pages.

**Q15: How does SCOP handle obsolete entries?**
A: By listing them and providing information on their replacements.

**Q16: What is the relationship between de-duplication and /ocker storage?**
A: De-duplication is used in /ocker storage to store only a single copy of a file and manage multiple links to it.

**Q17: Why is de-duplication important in web crawling?**
A: To improve search results by reducing the number of identical or nearly identical web pages indexed.

**Q18: What is the difference between identical and duplicate URLs?**
A: Identical URLs point to the same page, while duplicate URLs may point to different versions of the same page.

**Q19: How does SCOP classify proteins based on their structural similarity?**
A: By grouping them into folds, superfamilies, and families based on their 3D structure.

**Q20: What is the purpose of de-duplication in general?**
A: To reduce storage space by eliminating duplicate or identical data.
