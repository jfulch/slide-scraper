**Auto-Completion Cheat Sheet**

## KEY TERMS (most important definitions)

* **Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR)**: A statistical measure evaluating the correctness of responses to queries, ordered by probability.
* **Reciprocal Rank**: The multiplicative inverse of the rank of the first correct answer.

## ALGORITHMS

* **Google's Auto-Completion Algorithm**: Suggests possible completions starting from the 1st character entered.
* **Yahoo's Auto-Completion Algorithm**: Suggests possible completions after the 3rd character is entered, stopping when out of possibilities.
* **Bing's Auto-Completion Algorithm**: Uses previous queries to make educated guesses before user types a single character.

## FORMULAS

* **Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) Formula**:
	+ MRR = âˆ‘(1/rank) / Q
	+ Where: 
		- MRR: Mean Reciprocal Rank
		- rank: Rank of the first correct answer for each query
		- Q: Total number of queries

## MUST-KNOW FACTS

* Google's auto-completion starts on 1st character.
* Yahoo's auto-completion starts after 3rd character.
* Bing uses previous queries to make educated guesses.

## QUICK REFERENCE

| Algorithm | Description |
