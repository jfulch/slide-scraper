Based on the course content, here are three examples where web browser searches actually involve database queries:

**Example 1: E-commerce Product Search**
- Sample search query: "iPhone 15 Pro 256GB black"
- Database query: The search engine queries product databases containing:
  - Product specifications (model, storage, color)
  - Inventory levels
  - Pricing information
  - Customer reviews and ratings
  - Retailer information

**Example 2: Academic Paper Search**
- Sample search query: "machine learning natural language processing 2024"
- Database query: The system searches academic databases containing:
  - Paper titles, abstracts, and keywords
  - Author information and affiliations
  - Publication dates and journals
  - Citation counts and references
  - Full-text content indexes

**Example 3: Real Estate Search**
- Sample search query: "3 bedroom house under $500k Los Angeles"
- Database query: The platform queries property databases with:
  - Property specifications (bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage)
  - Location data (address, neighborhood, zip code)
  - Price history and current listing prices
  - Property tax information
  - School district ratings

In each case, what appears to be a simple web search is actually a complex database query that:
1. Parses the user's natural language query
2. Translates it into structured database queries
3. Searches multiple related tables/indexes
4. Ranks and filters results
5. Presents them in a user-friendly format

The user doesn't see the underlying SQL queries, API calls, or database operations - they just see search results that appear to come from a simple search interface.
