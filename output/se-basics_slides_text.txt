Archie, Veronica, Gopher
¢ By late 1980’s many files were available by anonymous
FTP.
* In 1990, Alan Emtage, P. Deutsch, et al of McGill Univ.
developed Archie (short for “archives”
— Assembled lists of files available on many FTP servers.
— Allowed regex search of these file names.
* In 1993, Veronica and Jughead were developed to search
names of text files available through Gopher servers
— The Gopher protocol is a TCP/IP application layer protocol designed
for distributing, searching, and retrieving documents over the Internet.
Strongly oriented towards a menu-document design
— The Gopher ecosystem is often regarded as the effective predecessor of
the World Wide Web

Slide: slide_004.png
------------------------------
¢ Excite came from the project Architext, which was started in
February, 1993 by six Stanford undergrad students.
— They had the idea of using statistical analysis of word relationships to
make searching more efficient.
— They were soon funded, and in mid 1993 they released copies of their
search software for use on web sites.
* Later developments
— Excite was bought by a broadband provider named @Home in January,
1999 for $6.5 billion, and was named Excite@Home. In October,
2001 Excite@Home filed for bankruptcy. InfoSpace bought Excite from
bankruptcy court for $10 million
— www.excite.com still exists as a portal

Slide: slide_005.png
------------------------------
¢ In June 1993 Matthew Gray while at MIT introduced the World Wide Web
Wanderer.
— Initial goal was to measure the growth of the web by counting active web-servers. He
soon upgraded the software to capture actual URL's. His database became known.as the
Wandex.
¢ The World Wide Web Wanderer was a Perl-based web crawler that was first
deployed in June 1993
¢ Matthew Gray now works for Google.
¢ While the Wanderer was probably the first web robot, and, with its index,
clearly had the potential to become a general-purpose WWW search engine
it never went that far
¢ The Wanderer charted the growth of the web until late 1995.

Slide: slide_006.png
------------------------------
¢ In November of 1993 Martijn Koster created “Archie-Like Indexing of the
Web”, or ALIWEB in response to the Wanderer.
— Some consider it to be the first Web search engine
¢ ALIWEB crawled meta information and allowed. users to submit their pages
they wanted indexed with their own page description.
¢ This meant it needed no bot to collect data and was not using excessive
bandwidth.
* One downside of ALIWEB was that people did not know how to submit
their site

Slide: slide_007.png
------------------------------
« AltaVista debut online came during December, 1995. AltaVista brought many
important features to the web scene.
— They were the first to allow natural language queries
— They offered advanced searching techniques
— They allowed users to add or delete their own URL within 24 hours.
— They even allowed inbound link checking. AltaVista also provided numerous
search tips and advanced search features.
* Later developments
— On February 18, 2003, Overture signed a letter of intent to buy AltaVista for
$80 million in stock and $60 million cash. After Yahoo! bought out Overture
they rolled some of the AltaVista technology into Yahoo! Search, and
occasionally used AltaVista as a testing platform.

Slide: slide_008.png
------------------------------
¢ Lycos was designed at Carnegie Mellon University around July of 1994.
Michael Loren Mauldin was responsible for this search engine and was the
chief scientist at Lycos Inc in the early years.
* On July 20, 1994, Lycos went public with a catalog of 54,000 documents.
— In addition to providing ranked relevance retrieval, Lycos provided prefix matching and
word proximity bonuses.
— Lycos' main difference was the sheer size of its catalog: by August 1994, Lycos had
identified 394,000 documents; by January 1995, the catalog had reached 1.5 million
documents; and by November 1996, Lycos had indexed over 60 million documents --
more than any other Web search engine.
¢ In October 1994, Lycos ranked first on Netscape's list of search engines
¢ Lycos has gone through a series of owners, and it still exists as
www.lycos.com

Slide: slide_009.png
------------------------------
* Infoseek also started out in 1994, founded by Steve Kirsch
* In December 1995 they convinced Netscape to use them as
their default search engine, which gave them major exposure.
* One popular feature of Infoseek was allowing webmasters to
submit a page to the search index in real time, which was a
search spammer's paradise
¢ They were the first search engine to sell advertising on a CPM
(Cost per Thousand) impressions basis
* Infoseek was bought by Walt Disney Company in 1998

Slide: slide_010.png
------------------------------
* In 1994, two Stanford Ph.D. students David Filo and Jerry Yang
posted web pages with links on them, organized into a topical
hierarchy.
* As the number of links began to grow, they developed a hierarchical
listing. As the pages become more popular, they developed a way to
search through all of the links.
¢ Early on all the links on the pages were updated manually rather than
automatically by spider or robot and the search feature searched only
those links
* Yahoo home page acted as a portal with Email, Finance, and Groups
being very successful; however after 2000 usage declined
¢ After many years of decline Yahoo was purchased by Verizon in 2017
for $4.48 billion, and it lives on

Slide: slide_011.png
------------------------------
NN s
LookSmart
Where To Look For What You Need:
¢ Looksmart was founded in 1995 in Australia. They competed with
the Yahoo! Directory by frequently increasing their inclusion rates
¢ Later developments
— In 2002 Looksmart transitioned into a pay per click provider,
which charged listed sites a flat fee per click. They syndicated
those paid listings to some major portals like MSN.
— The problem was that Looksmart became too dependant on
MSN, and in 2003, when Microsoft announced they were
dumping Looksmart that basically killed their business model.
— In March of 2002, Looksmart bought a search engine by the
name of WiseNut, but it never gained traction
* See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LookSmart

Slide: slide_012.png
------------------------------
* The Inktomi Corporation came about on May 20, 1996 with its search engine
Hotbot. Two Cal Berkeley cohorts created Inktomi from the improved technology
gained from their research
* Later developments
— In October of 2001 Inktomi accidentally allowed the public to access their
database of spam sites, which listed over 1 million URLs at that-time.
— Inktomi pioneered the paid inclusion model in which a website pays a fee to the
search engine that guarantees the site will be displayed when certain search
terms are entered
— The model was nowhere near as efficient as the pay-per-click auction model
developed by Overture. Licensing their search results also was not profitable
enough to pay for their scaling costs. They failed to develop a profitable
business model, and sold out to Yahoo! for approximately $235 million, or
$1.65 a share, in December of 2003.
*http://searchenginewatch.com/article/2066745/Inktomi-Spam-Database-Left-Open-To-Public

Slide: slide_013.png
------------------------------
* In April of 1997 Ask Jeeves was launched as a natural language
search engine.
— Ask Jeeves used human editors to try to match search queries.
— Ask was powered by DirectHit for a while, which aimed to rank
results based on their popularity, but that technology proved too
easy to spam.
— In 2000 the Teoma search engine was released, which uses
clustering to organize sites by Subject Specific Popularity,
which is another way of saying they tried to find local web
communities. In 2001 Ask Jeeves bought Teoma to replace the
DirectHit search technology.
— On March 21, 2005 Barry Diller's IAC agreed to acquire Ask
Jeeves for 1.85 billion dollars. [AC owns many popular websites
like Match.com, Ticketmaster.com, and Citysearch.com, and is
promoting Ask across their other properties.
— In 2006 Ask Jeeves was renamed to Ask.

Slide: slide_014.png
------------------------------
* Google is a play on the word Googol, coined by Milton Sirotta; it refers to
a 1 followed by 100 zeros, 10000000.....0
¢ A googol is bigger than the number of atoms in the universe
* Google was founded by Larry Page and Sergey Brin, two Stanford Univ.
Computer Science graduate students
¢ In 1998 they built a prototype system called BackRub, dropped out of
school, and tried to attract investors for their new company
* Google Inc. released a beta version on Sept. 7, 1998
* www.google.com was officially released on Sept. 21, 1999

Search Engine Basic Behavior

Slide: slide_017.png
------------------------------
¢ Providing access to heterogeneous, distributed information
that is publicly available on the World Wide Web
— Information comes in many different formats
— Most of the information has not been screened for accuracy
¢ Multi-billion dollar business
¢ Source of new opportunities in marketing
¢ Strains the boundaries of trademark and intellectual
property laws
¢ A source of unending technical challenges

Slide: slide_018.png
------------------------------
¢ “A search engine is a program designed to help find information stored
on a computer system such as the World Wide Web, inside a corporate
or proprietary network or a personal computer” wikipedia
— search engine usually refers to a Web search engine, which searches for
information on the public Web.
— Other kinds of search engine are enterprise search engines, which
search on intranets,
— personal search engines, which search individual personal computers

Slide: slide_020.png
------------------------------
¢ Spider (a.k.a. crawler/robot) — builds corpus
— Collects web pages recursively
* For each known URL, fetch the page, parse it, and extract new
URLs
* Repeat
— Additional pages come from direct submissions & other sources
¢ The indexer — creates inverted indexes
— Various policies wrt which words are indexed, capitalization, support
for Unicode, stemming, support for phrases, etc.
* Query processor — serves query results
— Front end — query reformulation, word stemming, capitalization,
optimization of Booleans, etc.
— Back end — finds matching documents and ranks them

Slide: slide_021.png
------------------------------
* No design/co-ordination
¢ Distributed content creation, linking
¢ Content includes truth, lies, obsolete
information, contradictions...
¢ Data is stored in structured
N / (databases), semi-structured (tables)...
¢ Scale larger than previous text corpora
| a * Growth — still expanding
* Content can be dynamically generated
The Web
Copyright Horowitz 2006-2022

Slide: slide_022.png
------------------------------
* Diverse in background/training
— Users sometimes cannot tell the difference between a search bar from the URL
address field (Chrome conflates the two)
— Users rarely use the scroll bar, so key results must be at or near the top
* Diverse in access methodology
— Increasingly, high bandwidth connectivity
— Growing segment of mobile users: limitations of form factor — keyboard,
display
¢ Diverse in search methodology
— Search, search + browse,
— Average query length ~ 2.5 terms
— Has to do with what they’re searching for
* Poor comprehension of syntax
— Early engines offered rich syntax for queries — Boolean, phrase, etc.
— Current engines hide these

Slide: slide_023.png
------------------------------
User’s Information Needs
Are Diverse
¢ Informational — want to learn about something (~40%)
e.g. Low hemoglobin
¢ Navigational — want to go to that page (~25%)
e.g. United Airlines
¢ Transactional — want to do something (web-mediated) (~35%)
— Access a service Los Angeles weather
— Downloads Mars surface images
— Shop Nikon CoolPix Camera
¢ Gray areas
— Find a good hub Car rental in Finland
— Exploratory search “see what’s there”

Slide: slide_024.png
------------------------------
* Query processing involves much more than just matching query terms with document
terms
¢ Semantic analysis of the query includes:
Determining the language of the query
Filtering of unnecessary words from the query (stop words)
3. Looking for specific types of queries, e.g.
* Personalities (triggered on names)
* Cities (travel info, maps)
* Medical info (triggered on names and/or results)
¢ Stock quotes, news (triggered on stock symbol)
* Company info...
Determining the user’s location or the target location of the query
5. Remembering previous queries
Maintaining a user profile

¢ The US is suing Google for anti-Trust violations
— Google claims it has strong competition in search!!!
— Google has sweetheart deals with Apple andpays Apple $8+
Billion/year to be their default search engine
* Google maintains the largest index of the web
— Some websites actually deny access to crawlers other than Google
and Bing as these other crawlers bring in little traffic and consume
server cycles
— Only Google and Bing have the resources to maintain such a large
index, e.g. DuckDuckGo no longer crawls the web and uses Bing’s
index
