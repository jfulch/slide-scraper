# ðŸ“– Se-Evaluation - Study Content

Here's the extracted content organized into the specified sections:

## DEFINITIONS & KEY TERMS

* **Precision**: The number of relevant documents retrieved divided by the total number of documents retrieved.
* **Recall**: The number of relevant documents retrieved divided by the total number of relevant documents in the collection.
* **Click-through Rate (CTR)**: The percentage of users who click on a result after searching for something.
* **Search Engine Algorithm**: A set of rules and processes used to rank search results.
* **Query Log Files**: A record of user searches, including query terms, URLs, ranks, and clicks.
* **Knowledge Graph**: A database that stores information about entities, their relationships, and attributes.

## ALGORITHMS & PROCESSES

### 1. Search Engine Algorithm (e.g., Google's algorithm)

* Step-by-step breakdown:
	+ Crawling: Web pages are crawled to build an index of content.
	+ Indexing: The crawled content is indexed for search.
	+ Query processing: When a user searches, the query is processed and matched against the index.
	+ Ranking: Results are ranked based on relevance, using factors like keyword matching, link equity, and user behavior.
* When/why it's used: To provide relevant search results to users.
* Key characteristics:
	+ Constantly updated and improved
	+ Uses a combination of algorithms and machine learning models

### 2. Click-through Rate (CTR) calculation

* Step-by-step breakdown:
	1. Count the number of clicks on a result.
	2. Count the total number of impressions (views) for that result.
	3. Divide the number of clicks by the number of impressions to get the CTR.

### 3. Query Log Analysis

* Step-by-step breakdown:
	1. Collect query log data from users.
	2. Analyze the data to identify trends, patterns, and user behavior.
	3. Use insights from analysis to improve search engine performance.

## FORMULAS & CALCULATIONS

### 1. Precision calculation

* Formula: Precision = (Number of relevant documents retrieved) / (Total number of documents retrieved)
* What each variable means:
	+ Number of relevant documents retrieved: The number of documents that are actually relevant to the user's query.
	+ Total number of documents retrieved: The total number of documents returned by the search engine.

### 2. Recall calculation

* Formula: Recall = (Number of relevant documents retrieved) / (Total number of relevant documents in the collection)
* What each variable means:
	+ Number of relevant documents retrieved: The number of documents that are actually relevant to the user's query.
	+ Total number of relevant documents in the collection: The total number of documents in the search engine's index that are relevant to the user's query.

## IMPORTANT FACTS & NUMBERS

* Google processes over 40,000 search queries every second.
* The average person spends around 1 hour per day searching online.
* Click-through rates can vary greatly depending on the position of a result (e.g., top results tend to have higher CTRs).

## CORE CONCEPTS EXPLAINED

* **Relevance**: How well a document matches a user's search query.
* **Ranking**: The process of ordering search results based on relevance and other factors.
* **Search Engine Optimization (SEO)**: Techniques used to improve the visibility and ranking of web pages in search engine results.

## EXAMPLES & APPLICATIONS

* Google's Knowledge Graph, which provides information about entities, their relationships, and attributes.
* Query log analysis, which helps identify trends and patterns in user behavior.
* Click-through rate calculation, which measures the effectiveness of search engine results.
