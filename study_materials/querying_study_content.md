Here are the extracted sections:

**DEFINITIONS & KEY TERMS**

* **Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR)**: A statistical measure for evaluating a process that produces a list of possible responses to a sample of queries, ordered by probability of correctness.
* **Reciprocal Rank**: The multiplicative inverse of the rank of the first correct answer.
* **Auto-Completion**: A feature that suggests possible completions for a partially typed query.

**ALGORITHMS & PROCESSES**

1. **Google's Auto-Completion Algorithm**
	* Step-by-step breakdown: Google starts suggesting possible completions on the first character entered, and continues to suggest alternatives as more characters are typed.
	* When/why it's used: To help users quickly find what they're looking for by providing likely completions for their query.
	* Key characteristics: Starts on the first character, continues to suggest alternatives as more characters are typed.
2. **Yahoo's Auto-Completion Algorithm**
	* Step-by-step breakdown: Yahoo starts suggesting possible completions after the third character is entered, and stops suggesting alternatives when it runs out of possibilities.
	* When/why it's used: To help users quickly find what they're looking for by providing likely completions for their query.
	* Key characteristics: Starts on the third character, stops suggesting alternatives when it runs out of possibilities.
3. **Bing's Auto-Completion Algorithm**
	* Step-by-step breakdown: Bing uses previous queries to make educated guesses about possible completions before the user even types a single character.
	* When/why it's used: To help users quickly find what they're looking for by providing likely completions for their query.
	* Key characteristics: Uses previous queries to make educated guesses, starts suggesting alternatives before the user types a single character.

**FORMULAS & CALCULATIONS**

1. **Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) Formula**
	* MRR = i=1^Q | rank; / Q
	* Where:
		+ MRR: Mean Reciprocal Rank
		+ i: Index of the query
		+ Q: Total number of queries
		+ rank: Rank of the first correct answer for each query

**IMPORTANT FACTS & NUMBERS**

1. Google's auto-completion algorithm starts suggesting possible completions on the first character entered.
2. Yahoo's auto-completion algorithm starts suggesting possible completions after the third character is entered.
3. Bing uses previous queries to make educated guesses about possible completions before the user even types a single character.
