# ðŸ“‹ Inverted Indexing - Cheat Sheet

**KEY TERMS**

* **Inverted Index**: A data structure mapping terms to documents containing them.
* **Term Frequency**: The number of times a term appears in a document.
* **Document Frequency**: The number of documents containing a particular term.
* **N-gram**: A sequence of n consecutive words or characters.
* **Part-of-Speech Tagging**: Identifying the grammatical category of each word.

**ALGORITHMS**

1. **Inverted Index Construction**: Tokenize, create unique terms, and map to documents.
2. **N-gram Indexing**: Identify N-grams and create inverted indexes for proximity searches.

**FORMULAS**

None mentioned in the slides.

**MUST-KNOW FACTS**

* Google's n-gram sample contains 1 trillion tokens and 95 billion sentences.
* The distribution of unique N-grams is similar between English and Chinese, but shifted to larger N in Chinese.
