# üÉè Inverted Indexing - Flashcards

Here are 20 flashcard pairs based on the lecture content:

**1. Q: What is an inverted index?**
A: A data structure that maps terms to documents, allowing for efficient querying.

**2. Q: What is a vocabulary in the context of an inverted index?**
A: A list of all distinct words in the text collection, in lexicographical order.

**3. Q: How are terms refined in an inverted file index?**
A: By case folding, stemming, and removing stop words.

**4. Q: What is a postings list?**
A: A list of documents that contain a particular term.

**5. Q: What are the two parts of an inverted index?**
A: The dictionary (index file) and the postings lists.

**6. Q: How are postings lists typically stored?**
A: On disk, with pointers to each list from the dictionary.

**7. Q: What is case folding in text processing?**
A: Converting all uppercase letters to lowercase.

**8. Q: What is stemming in text processing?**
A: Reducing words to their morphological roots.

**9. Q: What are stop words?**
A: Words that are so common they provide no information.

**10. Q: How does an inverted index allow for efficient querying?**
A: By storing a 0/1 vector for each term, indicating which documents it appears in.

**11. Q: What is the purpose of a sparse matrix representation of an inverted index?**
A: To efficiently store and query large datasets.

**12. Q: How do you represent terms as rows in a sparse matrix?**
A: As 0/1 vectors, where each entry indicates whether the term appears in the corresponding document.

**13. Q: What is the advantage of using an inverted index over traditional querying methods?**
A: It allows for efficient querying and storage of large datasets.

**14. Q: How does an inverted index handle phrase queries?**
A: By storing a list of documents that contain each term in the query.

**15. Q: What is biwording in text processing?**
A: Representing phrases as single units, rather than individual words.

**16. Q: What is grammatical tagging in text processing?**
A: Labeling words with their part-of-speech tags (e.g., noun, verb, adjective).

**17. Q: How does an inverted index handle distributed indexing?**
A: By storing a separate index for each node or shard in the system.

**18. Q: What is N-Gram analysis in text processing?**
A: Breaking down words into their constituent parts (e.g., prefixes, suffixes).

**19. Q: How does an inverted index improve query performance?**
A: By allowing for efficient filtering and pruning of search results.

**20. Q: What is the main advantage of using an inverted index over traditional indexing methods?**
A: It allows for efficient querying and storage of large datasets, with minimal overhead.
