**üéØ KEY CONCEPTS TO MASTER**

1. **Standing Queries**: Periodic queries for finding new documents on a specific topic
2. **Text Classification**: Categorizing documents into predefined classes (e.g., spam vs. non-spam)
3. **Supervised Learning**: Training algorithms using labeled training data to learn classification functions
4. **Naive Bayes**: A simple supervised learning algorithm for text classification
5. **Rocchio**: An algorithm for forming a representative prototype for each class
6. **k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)**: A lazy learning algorithm that finds the majority class label among k nearest neighbors
7. **Feature Selection**: Selecting relevant features from high-dimensional vector spaces to improve classification accuracy
8. **Bag of Words**: Representing documents as vectors using word frequencies or presence/absence
9. **Vector Space Classification**: Classifying documents in a high-dimensional vector space

**üß† MEMORY AIDS & STUDY TIPS**

1. **Mnemonic Device for Standing Queries:** "S-Q-U-I-R-E" - Search, Query, Understand, Identify, Recommend, Evaluate
2. **Naive Bayes Formula:** P(c|d) = (P(d|c) \* P(c)) / P(d)
3. **Rocchio Algorithm:** Form a prototype for each class by taking the centroid of labeled training examples
4. **kNN Concept:** "Closest Neighbors" - Find the majority class label among k nearest neighbors

**‚ùì PRACTICE QUESTIONS**

1. What is the main difference between text classification and ranking?
2. Describe a scenario where standing queries would be useful.
3. Explain how Naive Bayes works in the context of text classification.
4. Compare and contrast Rocchio and kNN algorithms for vector space classification.
5. How does feature selection improve classification accuracy in high-dimensional spaces?
6. What is the significance of the centroid/prototype in Rocchio's algorithm?
7. Describe a situation where kNN would be more accurate than Naive Bayes or Rocchio.
8. Explain why bag-of-words representation is useful for text classification.

**üîó CONNECTIONS**

* Text classification is closely related to information retrieval, as it helps filter and categorize documents in search results.
* Supervised learning algorithms like Naive Bayes, Rocchio, and kNN can be applied to various problems beyond text classification (e.g., image classification).
* Feature selection techniques are essential for dimensionality reduction in high-dimensional spaces.

**üìö STUDY STRATEGY**

1. **Start with the basics**: Understand the concepts of standing queries, supervised learning, and feature selection.
2. **Focus on key algorithms**: Study Naive Bayes, Rocchio, and kNN in detail, including their strengths and weaknesses.
3. **Practice problems**: Solve practice questions to reinforce understanding and identify areas for improvement.
4. **Apply concepts to real-world scenarios**: Use case studies or examples to illustrate how text classification techniques can be applied.
5. **Review and revise regularly**: Regularly review material, focusing on areas where you need improvement.

**Study Time Allocation:**

* 2-3 days for understanding the basics of text classification
* 4-6 hours for studying key algorithms (Naive Bayes, Rocchio, kNN)
* 2-3 days for practicing problems and applying concepts to real-world scenarios
* 1 day for reviewing and revising material

Note: Study time allocation may vary depending on individual learning pace.
