# üÉè Info Retrieval - Flashcards

Here are 20 flashcard pairs based on the lecture content:

**Q1: What is Information Retrieval (IR)?**
A1: A computer science subject that deals with indexing documents and retrieving relevant documents given a query.

**Q2: What was the "killer app" in IR?**
A2: Searching for pages on the World Wide Web.

**Q3: Who were the leading researchers in IR in the 1960s-70s?**
A3: Prof. Salton and his students at Cornell University.

**Q4: What were some of the early text retrieval systems?**
A4: Boolean and vector-space models.

**Q5: What is a document database system?**
A5: A large collection of documents stored in a database, often used by companies like Lexis-Nexis and Dialog.

**Q6: What was MEDLINE?**
A6: A National Library of Medicine health information database.

**Q7: What was Archie?**
A7: An early search engine that indexed FTP'able documents on the Internet.

**Q8: What were some popular search engines in the 1990s?**
A8: Lycos, Yahoo, and Altavista.

**Q9: What is a Recommender System?**
A9: A computer program that attempts to predict items a user may be interested in based on their profile.

**Q10: Examples of Recommender Systems include...**
A10: YouTube, Amazon's recommendation system, and Google's personalized search results.

**Q11: What is Automated Text Categorization & Clustering?**
A11: A system that groups news articles into categories.

**Q12: What was the purpose of NIST TREC (Text REtrieval Conferences)?**
A12: To evaluate and improve IR systems through organized competitions.

**Q13: What is Link Analysis in Web Search?**
A13: A technique used by Google to analyze links between web pages for ranking purposes.

**Q14: Why did Google limit its search results to 1000 per page?**
A14: For speed reasons, to prevent slow loading times.

**Q15: What is Collaborative Filtering?**
A15: An algorithm used in Recommender Systems that predicts user preferences based on the behavior of similar users.

**Q16: What is Vector-Space Model?**
A16: A mathematical model for representing documents as vectors in a high-dimensional space, allowing for efficient retrieval.

**Q17: What is Boolean Retrieval?**
A17: A model that uses logical operators (AND, OR, NOT) to retrieve documents based on keyword matches.

**Q18: What is the main difference between Vector-Space and Boolean models?**
A18: The former represents documents as vectors, while the latter uses logical operators for retrieval.

**Q19: Who sponsored NIST TREC?**
A19: National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).

**Q20: How many unique records does Dialog store?**
A20: Over 1.4 billion.
