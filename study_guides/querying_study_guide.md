# üéì Querying - Study Guide

Here is a comprehensive study guide based on the lecture notes:

**üìã LECTURE OVERVIEW**

* Main topic: Search Engine Auto-Completion
* Objectives:
	+ Understand how search engines auto-complete user queries
	+ Compare and contrast different search engine auto-completion algorithms (Google, Yahoo, Bing)
	+ Evaluate the effectiveness of search engine auto-completion using metrics such as Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR)
* Key difficulty level: Medium-High

**üéØ KEY CONCEPTS TO MASTER**

1. **Search Engine Auto-Completion**: The process by which search engines suggest possible completions for a user's query
2. **Google Auto-Completion Algorithm**: Uses n-gram models to predict the next character in a user's query
3. **Yahoo Auto-Completion Algorithm**: Starts auto-completion after 3 characters are entered, uses a combination of n-gram and Markov chain models
4. **Bing Auto-Completion Algorithm**: Does not wait for the first character to be entered, uses previous queries and enters possibilities before user types
5. **Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR)**: A statistical measure for evaluating search engine auto-completion effectiveness
6. **Reciprocal Rank**: The multiplicative inverse of the rank of the first correct answer in a list of possible responses
7. **N-gram Models**: Statistical models that predict the next character in a sequence based on previous characters
8. **Markov Chain Models**: Statistical models that predict the next state in a sequence based on current and previous states
9. **Query Suggestions**: Possible completions for a user's query, generated by search engines using auto-completion algorithms

**üß† MEMORY AIDS & STUDY TIPS**

* Use mnemonics to remember key concepts:
	+ "Google Grows" (n-gram models)
	+ "Yahoo Yields" ( combination of n-gram and Markov chain models)
	+ "Bing Brings" (uses previous queries and enters possibilities before user types)
* Create flashcards to practice recall of key concepts
* Use online resources, such as tutorials or videos, to visualize complex algorithms and concepts

**‚ùì PRACTICE QUESTIONS**

1. What is the primary difference between Google and Yahoo auto-completion algorithms?
	+ Basic Recall ( Short answer: Google uses n-gram models, while Yahoo uses a combination of n-gram and Markov chain models)
2. Suppose a user enters "mike garb" into a search engine. Which algorithm would correctly suggest "Gorbachev" as the next character?
	+ Application Problem (Short answer: Bing, because it uses previous queries to predict possibilities before user types)
3. What is the Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) metric used for in evaluating search engine auto-completion effectiveness?
	+ Analysis Question (Short answer: MRR measures the average reciprocal rank of results for a sample of queries)

**üîó CONNECTIONS**

* Search Engine Auto-Completion connects to other CS/Information Retrieval topics, such as:
	+ Natural Language Processing (NLP)
	+ Information Retrieval (IR)
	+ Machine Learning (ML)

**üìö STUDY STRATEGY**

* Allocate 2-3 hours per day for studying search engine auto-completion concepts
* Break down study material into smaller chunks and focus on one concept at a time
* Use online resources, such as tutorials or videos, to visualize complex algorithms and concepts
* Practice recalling key concepts using flashcards or practice questions
* Review and practice regularly to build mastery of the material
