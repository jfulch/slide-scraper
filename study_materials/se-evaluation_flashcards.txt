# üÉè Se-Evaluation - Flashcards

Here are 20 flashcard pairs based on the lecture content:

**Q1: What is Precision?**
A1: The number of relevant items retrieved divided by the total number of items retrieved.

**Q2: What is Recall?**
A2: The number of relevant items retrieved divided by the total number of relevant items.

**Q3: What is the formula for Precision?**
A3: tp / (tp + fp)

**Q4: What is the formula for Recall?**
A4: tp / (tp + fn)

**Q5: What is the definition of Accuracy?**
A5: The fraction of correct classifications out of total classifications.

**Q6: Why is Precision more important than Recall in web applications?**
A6: Because it's better to retrieve a small number of relevant items with high precision than a large number of irrelevant items.

**Q7: What is the relationship between Precision and Recall?**
A7: They are inversely related, meaning that as one increases, the other decreases.

**Q8: How can you get high Recall but low Precision?**
A8: By retrieving all documents for all queries, which results in a large number of irrelevant items.

**Q9: What is the Harmonic Mean?**
A9: A measure of central tendency that tends towards the least element in the list.

**Q10: How do you calculate the Harmonic Mean?**
A10: By taking the nth root of the product of n numbers.

**Q11: What are the three Pythagorean Means?**
A11: Arithmetic Mean, Geometric Mean, and Harmonic Mean.

**Q12: Why is the Harmonic Mean useful in analyzing search engine results?**
A12: Because it tends towards the least element in the list, making it a good measure of central tendency for skewed data.

**Q13: What are the elements of Good Search Results?**
A13: Google's Search Quality Guidelines and using log files for evaluation.

**Q14: What is A/B Testing?**
A14: A method of comparing two versions of a search engine to see which one performs better.

**Q15: How do you calculate Mean Average Precision (MAP)?**
A15: Not specified in the lecture content, but it's an important metric for evaluating search engines.

**Q16: What is Discounted Cumulative Gain (DCG)?**
A16: A measure of ranking quality that takes into account the position and relevance of each item.

**Q17: What are the key differences between Precision and Recall?**
A17: Precision measures the number of relevant items retrieved, while Recall measures the number of relevant items not yet retrieved.

**Q18: How do you calculate the Geometric Mean?**
A18: By taking the nth root of the product of n numbers.

**Q19: What is the relationship between Precision and the number of documents retrieved?**
A19: As the number of documents retrieved increases, precision typically decreases.

**Q20: Why is it not a good strategy to retrieve all documents for all queries?**
A20: Because it results in a large number of irrelevant items, leading to low Precision.
