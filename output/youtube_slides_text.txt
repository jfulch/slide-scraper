« A video search engine is a web-based search engine which crawls the web
primarily for video content.
— YouTube is not strictly a video search engine as it does not crawl the web
looking for video content
* The indexing of video content is normally done by acquiring meta-data associated
with the video, e.g.
— Author, title, creation date, duration, coding quality, tags, description
— Other aspects of video recognition are subtitles (using formats STR or SUB) and
transcription (using format TTXT)
* The ranking of videos under a query is generally done using:
— Relevance: using metadata and user preferences
— Ordered by date of upload
— Ordered by number of views So indexing and ranking
— Ordered by duration are a lot simpler than
for document search
— Ordered by user rating engines

* A few remain
— Bing does crawl for videos, see https://www.bing.com/videos/
— blinkx (renamed as RhythmOne) was launched in 2004 and uses speech
recognition and visual analysis to process downloaded video rather than rely on
metadata alone

------------------------------
* Largely because of the large file sizes involved, video hosting is highly concentrated
on a fairly small number of websites
— vimeo.com, first to support HD video, focuses on short, arty, films
— vevo.com, a joint venture of Universal Music Group, Sony Music Entertainment
and Warner Music Group
— dailymotion.com, owned by Vivendi, hosts high quality videos
* Most of these websites which host video allow their videos to,be embedded on other
websites
* YouTube.com has become the defacto site for uploading videos
* — It is legal to crawl YouTube, see their Terms of Service,
www. youtube.com/static?template=terms
* “3, You are not allowed to access the Service using any automated means (such as robots,
botnets or scrapers) except (a) in the case of public search engines,.in accordance with
YouTube’s robots.txt file; or (b) with YouTube’s prior written permission;”

+ Subtitles: there are two formats, one for subtitles and one for transcripts
— There are three main types of video subtitling services:
1. open caption: burned into the video
2. closed caption: can be turned on/off, generally at the bottom of the screen
3. SDH (Subtitles for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing): similar to closed-caption, but
includes words describing actions or moods
— SRT or SUB for subtitles
* SRT. srt) stands for “SubRip Subtitle” file, and it's the most common
subtitle/caption file format. It is a text format
— TYXT for transcripts
+ Speech Recognition, used to extract phrases from audio transcripts for better indexing
— Gaudi, Google Audio Indexing uses voice recognition to locate the exact spot where
words are spoken
—_ https://www.searchenginejournal.com/google-audio-search-will-it-ever-be-
possible/397129/
— Text Recognition: uses OCR on video slides to detect words,

* YouTube uses the following metrics for ranking search results:
1. Meta Data
— video titles, descriptions and tags are core ranking factors
— include links to a website and social profiles
2. Video Quality
— HD ranks higher than low quality videos
3. Number of views, likes, shares and links
Subtitles and Closed Captions
— captions are crawled by the YouTube search engine and used for ranking
* What is not known is how YouTube weights the individual
factors to make up their final ranking

Slide: s19.png
------------------------------
* YouTube Upload Characteristics
YouTube supports 8 video formats for uploading: MOV, MP4 (MPEG4), AVI,
WMV, FLV, 3GP, MPEGPS, WebM
Aspect Ratio: the standard aspect ratios are: 4:3 or 16:9. When the video is
uploaded to the site, YouTube will either leave it as-is (for 16:9) or add vertical
black bars (for 4:3)
The maximum file size you can upload to YouTube is 128GB.
By default, you can upload videos that are up to 15 minutes long, though
that can be extended
Many videos have a short life cycle, e.g. a recent tennis match that is soon
forgotten, however, there is no time limit for videos to remain on YouTube,
unless
* You delete the video.
* You delete your account.
* You violate copyright or community guidelines

Slide: s20.png
------------------------------
* Desktops/laptops
— Videos are played in your browser assuming it supports HTMLS
— This avoided the need to use Adobe Flash Player
¢ Smartphones
— YouTube apps exist for Android and iPhone devices
¢ There is no native support for running YouTube videos so a separate app is
required
— For YouTube's videos to run on Apple products YouTube's content had to be
transcoded into Apple's preferred video standard, H.264
* Other Devices
— Apple TV, Fire TV, iPod Touch,
— TiVo, PlayStation, Wii Game consoles,
— Xbox Live, Roku Players
— Google Chromecast

Video transcoding is a technique of
converting a video into multiple different
formats and resolutions to make it playable
across different devices and bandwidths.
The technique is also known as video
encoding. This enables YouTube to
stream videos in different resolutions such as
144p, 240p, 360p, 480p, 720p, 1080p & 4K.

by Jefay
YouTube Traffic Dynamics and Its InterPlay with a Tier-1 ISP, 2010

¢ All of the papers describe a complicated re-direction scheme to find the
nearest data center to serve the video; they attempt to minimize Round Trip
Time or RTT
¢ For rarely-called-for videos the “Dissecting” paper did a study requesting in
California a rare video and observed that the first request came from the
Netherlands, but future requests were served from California
— Conclusion: videos are constantly being moved around to be closer to the
place that is requesting then,

* YouTube challenges in the early days
YouTube had no way of making money and its infrastructure is very expensive
YouTube was being sued by content creators as many of YouTube’ s videos were
uploaded illegally
YouTube solved both problems at once, by
* Developing a system for spotting copyrighted content
+ Allowing the copyright owner to decide if he wants to keep the content on the
site and let ads appear, splitting the revenue with YouTube or taking the content
down
Here is a video that describes how YouTubers make money
https://www.youtube.com/watch? v=v8F4jrtZtNE
(8 min)

Slide: s34.png
------------------------------
* YouTube’s solution was to create a fingerprint database of copyrighted
content, called Content ID
* YouTube solicited cooperation from content owners asking them to submit
copies of their content so YouTube could fingerprint them
— There are millions of reference files in YouTube’ s Content ID database.
* When a new video is uploaded, it is immediately checked against the
database, and the video is flagged as a copyright violation ifa match is found.
¢ When this occurs, the content owner has the choice of
1. blocking the video to make it unviewable,
2. tracking the viewing statistics of the video, or
3. adding advertisements to the video
https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy-policy/2014/10/youtube-has-paid-1-billion-to-rights-holders-via-content-id-since-2007/

Slide: s35.png
------------------------------
Content ID is based off audio and video samples that rights holders have uploaded to YouTube
User uploads a video.
YouTube then queues up the video to be processed i.e. it is transcoded into multiple formats
including:
— HTML5, H.264, WebM VP8, HD, non-HD, and others
4. If the video contains audio, a hash is then calculated based off a time frequency graph called a
spectrogram.
— Target zones (peak points in the spectrogram) are marked, then the target area between
them is also taken and hashed
5. For the video portion, a sample section of frames of the video is taken.
— A hash is created from those sampled frames of the video
* Note recently YouTube has introduced a new version of ContentID it calls Copyright Match
* See the following videos for details, (2 min). https://youtu.be/5-2R-IZITZ8

_ Creating an
Acoustic Fingerprint
¢ The audio signal is digitized and converted to a spectrogram — a time-
frequency graph
The graph below plots three dimensions of audio: frequency versus amplitude
versus time
— Acommon format is a graph with two dimensions: one axis represents time, and
the other axis represents frequency; a third dimension indicating the
amplitude of a particular frequency at a particular time is represented by the
intensity or color of each point in the image.

Time axis

Slide: s37.png
------------------------------
* According to stats released by YouTube 99.5 percent of all copyright issues
specifically related to sound recordings are automatically resolved by Content ID
¢ In addition to music, Content ID also identifies 98% of copyright claims, including
those tied to film, TV, gaming
¢ The actual hashing algorithm used by YouTube remains proprietary, but it has been
suggested that YouTube uses finite-state transducers to compute the hash function,
e.g. see
« Eugene Weinstein, Pedro J. Moreno; Music Identification with Weighted Finite-State
Transducers, Proceedings of the International Conference in Acoustics, Speech and
Signal Processing (ICASSP), 2007

* The storage you can buy with $100 Gigabytes of storage you can buy with $100

equivalently, the cost of storing 1GB 4500
of videos has decreased exponentially 4000

From multiple sources we know that there is roughly 1 Billion videos that have been uploaded
to YouTube to date. Assuming each video has on average size of 86MB we can compute their
total storage needs as:
86MB * 4 (for profiles) * 1,000,000,000 = 320PB
So it is estimated that YouTube needs to have at least 320PB of storage currently and that
the storage needs are growing each year by 35 PetaBytes
