¢ The path from IR to text classification:
— You have an information need to monitor, say:
¢ Unrest in the Niger delta region
— You want to rerun an appropriate query periodically to find new
news items on this topic
— You will be sent new documents that are found
* Le., it’ s not ranking but classification (relevant vs. not relevant)
¢ Such queries are called standing queries
— Long used by “information professionals”
— A modern mass instantiation is Google Alerts
¢ Standing queries are (hand-written) text classifiers

¢ Given:
— A representation of a document d
¢ Issue: how to represent text documents.
¢ Usually some type of high-dimensional space — bag of words
— A fixed set of classes:
C= {Cp Cy... Cf
¢ Determine:
— The category of d by generating a classification
function, say y(d)
— We want to build classification functions (“classifiers”).

¢ Manual classification
— Used by the original Yahoo! Directory
— Looksmart, about.com, ODP, PubMed
— Accurate when job is done by experts
— Consistent when the problem size and team is small
— Difficult and expensive to scale
« Means we need automatic classification methods for big
problems

Slide: s7.png
------------------------------
¢ Hand-coded rule-based classifiers
— One technique used by news agencies,
intelligence agencies, etc.
— Widely deployed in government and enterprises
— Vendors provide “IDE” for writing such rules

Slide: s8.png
------------------------------
¢ Hand-coded rule-based classifiers
— Commercial systems have complex query
languages
— Accuracy is can be high if a rule has been
carefully refined over time by a subject expert
— Building and maintaining these rules is
expensive

Slide: s9.png
------------------------------
* Given:
— A document d
— A fixed set of classes:
C= {Cp Cy... Cf
— A training set D of documents each with a label in C
* Determine:
— A learning method or algorithm which will enable us to
learn a classifier y
— For a test document d, we assign it the class
y(d) EC

------------------------------
¢ Supervised learning
— Naive Bayes (simple, common)
— k-Nearest Neighbors (simple, powerful)
— Support-vector machines (newer, generally more
powerful)
— ... plus many other methods
— No free lunch: requires hand-classified training data
— But data can be built up (and refined) by amateurs
¢ Many commercial systems use a mixture of
methods

I love this movie! It's sweet,
but with satirical humor. The
dialogue is great and the
adventure scenes are fun... It
manages to be whimsical and
romantic while laughing at the
conventions of the fairy tale
genre. I would recommend it to
just about anyone. I've seen it
several times, and I'm always
happy to see it again whenever
I have a friend who hasn't seen
it yet.

* Supervised learning classifiers can use any sort of
feature
— URL, email address, punctuation, capitalization,
dictionaries, network features
¢ In the simplest bag of words view of documents
— We use only word features
— we use all of the words in the text (not a subset)

Slide: s14.png
------------------------------
¢ Text collections have a large number of features
— 10,000 — 1,000,000 unique words ... and more
¢ Selection may make a particular classifier feasible
— Some classifiers can’ t deal with 1,000,000 features
¢ Reduces training time
— Training time for some methods is quadratic or worse in the
number of features
¢ Makes runtime models smaller and faster
¢ Can improve generalization (performance)
— Eliminates noise features
— Avoids overfitting

Slide: s15.png
------------------------------
¢ The simplest feature selection method:
— Just use the most common terms
— No particular foundation
— But it make sense why this works
¢ They are the words that can be well-estimated and
are most often available as evidence
— In practice, this is often 90% as good as better
methods
— Smarter feature selection — future lecture

¢ Naive Bayes has found a home in spam
filtering
— Paul Graham’ s A Plan for Spam
* http://www.paulgraham.com/spam.html
— Widely used in spam filters
— But many features beyond words:
¢ black hole lists, etc.
* particular hand-crafted text patterns

Slide: s24.png
------------------------------
* Each document is a vector, one component for
each term (= word).
* Normally normalize vectors to unit length.
¢ High-dimensional vector space:
— Terms are axes
— 10,000+ dimensions, or even 100,000+
— Does are vectors in this space
* How can we do classification in this space?

Slide: s25.png
------------------------------
¢ In vector space classification, training set
corresponds to a labeled set of points
(equivalently, vectors)
e Premise 1: Documents in the same class form a
contiguous region of space
¢ Premise 2: Documents from different classes don’t
overlap (much)
¢ Learning a classifier: build surfaces to delineate
classes in the space

¢ Where D, is the set of all documents that belong to
class c and v(d) is the vector space representation of
¢ Note that centroid will in general not be a unit
vector even when the inputs are unit vectors.

Slide: s30.png
------------------------------
¢ Rocchio forms a simple representative for
each class: the centroid/prototype
¢ Classification: nearest prototype/centroid

e kNN = k Nearest Neighbor
¢ To classify a document d:
¢ Define k-neighborhood as the k nearest neighbors of
¢ Pick the majority class label in the k-neighborhood
e For larger k can roughly estimate P(c|d) as #(c)/k

e Learning: just store the labeled training examples D
¢ Testing instance x (under 1NN):
— Compute similarity between x and all examples in D.
— Assign x the category of the most similar example in D.
© Does not compute anything beyond storing the examples
Also called:
— Case-based learning
— Memory-based learning
— Lazy learning
¢ Rationale of kNN: contiguity hypothesis

Slide: s37.png
------------------------------
e Using only the closest example (1NN) subject to errors due
to:
— Asingle atypical example.
— Noise (i.e., an error) in the category label of a single
training example.
¢ More robust: find the k examples and return the majority
category of these k
e kis typically odd to avoid ties; 3 and 5 are most common

Slide: s39.png
------------------------------
¢ No feature selection necessary
No training necessary
Scales well with large number of classes
— Don’t need to train n classifiers for n classes
Classes can influence each other
— Small changes to one class can have ripple effect
¢ Done naively, very expensive at test time
In most cases it’s more accurate than NB or Rocchio
