**SIMILARITY SEARCH CHEAT SHEET**

## KEY TERMS (most important definitions)

* **Jaccard Coefficient**: Measure of similarity between two sets, defined as intersection size divided by union size.
* **Hamming Distance**: Number of positions at which two strings differ in a sequence alignment.
* **SimHash**: Hash function that produces similar outputs for similar inputs, used to estimate document similarity.
* **Fingerprint**: Compact representation of a document's content.

## ALGORITHMS (names and what they do)

* **SimHash Algorithm**: Estimates document similarity by producing similar outputs for similar inputs.
* **Permutation Algorithm**: Preserves Hamming distance by permuting bits.

## FORMULAS

* **Jaccard Coefficient Formula**: J = |A âˆ© B| / |A âˆª B|
* **Hamming Distance Formula**: HD = number of positions at which two strings differ

## MUST-KNOW FACTS

* Typical values for f and k: f=64, k=3 (for SimHash)
* Bitwise Hamming distance between similar items can be small.

## QUICK REFERENCE

* Similarity search: Finding documents similar to a given query document.
* Clustering: Grouping similar documents together based on content.
