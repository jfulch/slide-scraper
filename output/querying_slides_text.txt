¢ Ifyou search for more than one keyword at a time, Google/Bing will
automatically search for pages that contain ALL of your keywords
— This is called “implicit AND”
¢ A search for
disney disneyland pirates
is the same as searching for
disney AND disneyland AND pirates
(without the ANDs needed)
* Google sometimes returns pages that don’t contain all of your query
terms

Slide: s6.png
------------------------------
¢ To search for phrases, just put your
phrase in quotes.
¢ For example,
disney disneyland “pirates of the
caribbean”
¢ This would show you all the pages in
Google’s index that contain the word
disney AND the word disneyland
AND the exact phrase “pirates of
the Caribbean” (of course, without

Google Stemming

* The query [child bicycle helmet] finds pages that contain
words that are similar to some or all of your search terms,
— eg., “child,” “children,” or “children's,” “bicycle,” “bicycles,”
“bicycle's,” “bicycling,” or “bicyclists,” and “helmet” or “helmets.”
— Google calls this feature word variations or automatic stemming
* Google will often ignore Stop Words
— However, a query with only Stop Words, e.g. [the who] gets treated
as significant, returning pages for the Rock Group, the Who
¢ Google limits queries to 32 words
— Google will return nonsense results for this nonsense query

------------------------------
* Google favors results that have your search terms near each other
— The query [snake grass] finds pages about plants;
— The query [snake in the grass] finds pages about sneaky people
* Google gives higher priority to pages that have the terms in the same
order as in your query
* Google is NOT case sensitive; it shows both upper- and lowercase
results
— [Red Cross ], [ red cross ], and [ RED CROSS ] return the same results.
* Google ignores some punctuation and special characters, including ! ? ,

Google paid teachers to classify pages for different reading levels, and then took their
classifications to build a statistical model. With this model, they can compare the words

Regular expression engine {esi}
The site allowed the use of regular expressions in queries, which atthe time was not offered by any other search engine for code,(“taton eedect This makes it resemble grep, but
‘over the world's public cade. The methodology employed combines a trigram index with a custom-built, denia-of-service resistant regular expression engine."
In March 2010, the code of RE2, the regular expression engine used in Google Code Search, was made open source.21
Google Code Search supported POSIX extended regular expression syntax, excluding back-references, collating elements, and collation classes,
Languages not officially supported could be searched for using the file: operator to match the common file extensions for the language.
Discontinuation {edit}
in October 2011, Google announced that Code Search was to be shut down along with the Code Search API. The service remained online until March 2013, and it now retums

Google Books is a service that searches
the full text of books and magazines that Google
has scanned, converted to text using optical character
recognition (OCR), and stored in its digital database
Books are provided either by
publishers and authors, through the Google
Books Partner Program, or by
*Google's library partners, through the Library Project.
Controversey:
Google has been criticized for potential copyright
violations, and lack of editing to correct the many errors
introduced into the scanned texts by the OCR process.
As of October 2015, the number of scanned book
titles was over 25 million.
Google estimated in 2010 that there were about
130 million distinct titles in the world,
and stated that it intended to scan all of them

Auto-Completion

Slide: s44.png
------------------------------
* Auto-completion is the process of predicting a word or phrase that the user
wants to type in without the user actually typing it in completely
« Auto-completion is a form of relevance feedback
— This feature is effective when it is easy to predict the word being typed, e.g.
when a browser fills in your name, address and/or email in a form;
— Search engines may use past history, phonetic Soundex algorithms, and
spelling corrections algorithms to assist in making guesses;
— The challenge is to search a large index or a long list of popular queries in a
very short amount of time so the results pop up while the useris typing

As the user types more

* The mean reciprocal rank is a statistical measure for evaluating any process that produces a list
of possible responses to a sample of queries, ordered by probability of correctness.
The reciprocal rank of a query response is the multiplicative inverse of the rank of the first
correct answer
* The mean reciprocal rank is the average of the reciprocal ranks of results for a sample of
queries MRR = i s 1 ;
Q| rank;
+ For example, suppose we have the following three sample queries for a system that tries to
translate English words to their plurals. In each case, the system makes three guesses, with the
first one being the one it thinks is most likely correct:
Query Results Correct response Rank Reciprocal rank
cat catten, cati,cats cats 3 1/3
tori torii, tori, toruses _ tori 2 1/2
virus viruses, Virii, viri viruses 1 1
the mean reciprocal rank as (1/3 + 1/2 + 1)/3 = 11/18 or about 0.61.
