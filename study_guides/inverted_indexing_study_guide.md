# üéì Inverted Indexing - Study Guide

Here is a study guide based on the lecture notes:

**üìã LECTURE OVERVIEW**

* Main topic: Inverted Indexing in Information Retrieval
* Objectives:
	+ Understand the concept of an inverted index and its importance in IR
	+ Learn how to build and query an inverted index
	+ Analyze the trade-offs between different indexing strategies
* Key difficulty level: Intermediate

**üéØ KEY CONCEPTS TO MASTER**

1. **Inverted Index**: A data structure that maps each word in a document to a list of documents containing that word.
2. **Posting List**: The list of documents associated with a particular term in the inverted index.
3. **Term Frequency (TF)**: The number of times a term appears in a document.
4. **Document Frequency (DF)**: The number of documents containing a particular term.
5. **Inverted Index Construction**: The process of building an inverted index from a collection of documents.
6. **Querying the Inverted Index**: The process of finding relevant documents based on a query string.
7. **N-Grams**: Sequences of n consecutive words in a document.
8. **Bi-words**: Pairs of consecutive words in a document (a special case of N-Grams).
9. **Positional Indexing**: A technique for storing the position of each word in a document.
10. **Distributed Computing**: The use of multiple machines to build and query an inverted index.

**üß† MEMORY AIDS & STUDY TIPS**

* Use mnemonics such as "POST" to remember the components of a posting list (Position, Offset, Term).
* Practice building and querying an inverted index using sample data.
* Understand the trade-offs between different indexing strategies, such as time vs. space complexity.

**‚ùì PRACTICE QUESTIONS**

1. What is the difference between an inverted index and a traditional database index?
2. How do you build an inverted index from a collection of documents?
3. What are some common techniques for querying an inverted index?
4. What is the purpose of positional indexing in an inverted index?
5. How does distributed computing improve the efficiency of building and querying an inverted index?

**üîó CONNECTIONS**

* Inverted indexing is a fundamental concept in Information Retrieval, used in search engines such as Google.
* The concepts learned here can be applied to other areas of Computer Science, such as database systems and data mining.

**üìö STUDY STRATEGY**

1. **Read the lecture notes carefully**, taking note of key definitions and formulas.
2. **Practice building and querying an inverted index** using sample data.
3. **Review and analyze the trade-offs between different indexing strategies**.
4. **Practice answering exam-style questions** to ensure understanding and retention of concepts.
